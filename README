This was a web application I started developing using CakePHP and ExtJS.  Used the ajile library (http://ajile.net/) to import and load javascript dynamically.  For the ExtJS stuff I created a custom theme that looked sort of "Apple/OS X-ish."  I ran out of time to work on this project, but decided to put it up on github anyways.

I threw all of the CakePHP and ExtJS libs on here, but the directories with the code relevant to the app can be found here:

I don't have this app hosted anywhere but a local MAMP install on my MacBook Pro, but you can find screenshots here:
